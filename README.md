# Dog Breed Explorer

## Description

Dog Breed Explorer is a mobile application built using React Native that allows users to explore various dog breeds. The app provides two main screens: the List screen and the Search screen.

### List Screen

The List screen displays a list of different dog breeds. Each breed is represented as a clickable item in the list. When the user taps on a breed, the app fetches a random image of that breed and displays it along with a "Back" button to return to the list.

#### How it works

- The app fetches the list of all dog breeds from the Dog API (https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all) using the axios library.
- The fetched breed names are then displayed as clickable items in a FlatList component.
- When a breed is selected, the app fetches a random image of that breed from the Dog API using the breed name and axios.
- The image is displayed on the screen along with a "Back" button that allows the user to return to the list.

### Search Screen

The Search screen allows users to search for a specific dog breed by entering its name in a search bar. Upon entering a breed name and tapping the search button, the app fetches a random image of the corresponding breed and displays it on the screen.

#### How it works

- The user enters a dog breed name in the search bar.
- Upon tapping the search button, the app makes a request to the Dog API with the entered breed name using axios.
- If the breed is found, the app displays the random image of the breed.
- If the breed is not found or there is an error during the request, appropriate error messages are displayed.
